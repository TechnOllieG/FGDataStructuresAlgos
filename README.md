# FGDataStructuresAlgos
Repo for assignments in the FG course data structures &amp; Algorithms

All relevant algorithms is in Unity/DataStructures&Algos/Assets/Other algos (Binary Tree, Pathfinding).<br>
Go in to the relevant folder and open the scene, both algorithms will execute at runtime.<br>
- For the binary tree, start the game and in the scene view the tree will generate on the canvas.<br>
- In the pathfinding scene it will execute automatically at runtime, but you can move around the target to recalculate the path.
